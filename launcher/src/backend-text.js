// Text the Rust side (src-tauri) sends to the page, in the player's language: error sentences, the readiness detail, preflight checks, setup and
// play progress. Rust writes English only, so each sentence is matched by its English text and translated through i18n.js.
//
//   TEXTS     one entry per sentence Rust can send, in Rust's own words. {1}, {2}... stand for the `{}` of its format! string (paths, another
//             message); {n1}, {n2}... for a number (a count, a size), which matches digits only; a text with none is matched whole. Keep an entry equal to the Rust string it stands for: a changed
//             sentence stops matching and shows in English until its entry follows.
//   fromBackend(text)  the text in the player's language: the whole text when it matches an entry, else each of its sentences (Rust joins
//             several into one message), else the text as it is. What a {n} holds is translated too, since it may be another message.
//
// Pure, no DOM and no Tauri, so `node --test` runs it. Pages call fromBackend() where they show a backend text; logic that reads a backend
// text (action.js gamePhase) keeps the raw one.
